# Heart-Failure-Prediction-and-Deployment-with-Flask-and-Heroku
Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.  

Early detection, and managment of cardiovascular diseases can be a great way to manage the fatality rate associated with cardiovascular diseases, and this is where a machine learning model comes in. 

For the purpose of predicting the risk of a  heart failure in patients, I used the Support Vector Classifier to build a machine learning model, and deployed it using Flask and Heroku
